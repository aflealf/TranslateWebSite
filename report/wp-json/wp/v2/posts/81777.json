Most of the courses are free and interactive.<\/p>\n<p>Vim is a highly-versatile text editor and language that developers learn to improve their productivity. How? By making writing and reading code less of a pain. By giving developers an ultra-efficient language that understands the needs of a programmer, developers can edit code nearly as fast as their brains think.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my top picks.

Vim is cross-platform\u2009\u2014\u2009it comes preinstalled on Linux and Mac, and can be installed on Windows.<\/p>\n<p>The reason behind why Vim has maintained a passionate following for decades is its extreme efficiency for developers. Often, programmers spend more time reading code and making changes here and there than writing long streams of code. But traditional text editors are more suited towards writing than reading.<\/p>\n<p>Vim solves this problem by introducing modes. Keys behave differently depending on the mode you\u2019re in. There\u2019s a mode for navigation, insertion, selection, entering commands, and so on. Although this may sound complicated, you quickly reap the benefits of having dedicated modes once you get used to it.<\/p>\n<p>Another big feature of Vim that makes it so efficient is that it doesn\u2019t use the mouse. Every action is solely performed with the keyboard. You may think that this is counterintuitive towards productivity as you\u2019d need to memorize dozens of macros, but it actually isn\u2019t due to one special feature: composition.<\/p>\n<p>Vim is a language. Each key can be composed with other keys in sequence to combine their actions together, leading you to typing what you think instead of thinking what to type. Vim is also smart. It understands words and more, so you can move from word to word instead of character to character as you did with the arrow keys.<\/p>\n<p>It is due to these neat ideas that lots of tools support a Vim emulation mode (VSCode, JetBrains\u2019 IDEs). Even if you don\u2019t find the idea of using a terminal emulator pleasing, you can still carry over the Vim language to your preferred text editor! Additionally, Vim is very customizable\u2009\u2014\u2009you can change its configuration settings and even install plugins that change Vim in a fundamental way.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central.com\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

It\u2019s an excellent introduction for beginners who want to get up and running with Vim without wasting too much time.<\/p>\n<p>To access the course, if you\u2019re in a Unix environment type <i>vimtutor<\/i> in your console. Or if you\u2019re on Windows, there should be an entry in the start menu folder titled <i>vimtutor<\/i> once you\u2019ve downloaded Vim.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course by learning to open Vim and move the cursor around using the hjkl keys. After inserting and deleting some text, you\u2019ll save and exit Vim safely.<\/p>\n<p>Navigating solely by the hjkl keys is slow, though. So you\u2019ll one up your speed by learning to execute motions, like moving word by word or even deleting entire words and lines (don\u2019t worry, you can undo and redo them).<\/p>\n<p>You know how to write new code, but more often, you\u2019ll paste or replace a wide selection of text. The next lesson teaches you exactly that, along with the find and replace tool, which is incredibly handy for changing repeated blocks of code.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, the course teaches you how to run shell commands within Vim, which can help you save code snippets in different files. You\u2019ll also learn how to append text below or above your cursor, copy, and paste text \u2014 all of which are immense time-savers. Finally, you\u2019ll find out how to configure the Vim startup script to your own preference and also learn to consult Vim\u2019s help manual whenever you need a refresher.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 1\u20132 hours long and consists of 7 lessons. You\u2019ll learn by completing the engaging exercises and taking notes of the commands.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Vim<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>1\u20132 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Vimtutor was originally written for Vi by Michael C.

The course doesn\u2019t teach all of Vim\u2019s functionality\u2009\u2014\u2009you\u2019ll only learn the basics and be shown a quick demonstration of Vim\u2019s advanced features. Instead, you\u2019ll focus on learning the philosophy behind Vim, giving you some background behind why Vim is the way it is.<\/p>\n<p>No prior experience with Vim is needed to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by introducing you to Vim\u2019s philosophy \u2014 modal editing. As programmers spend a lot of time reading, navigating, and making minor edits here and there instead of writing long streams of text at once, Vim splits its operation into (mainly) three modes: Normal (for navigating), Insert (for editing), and Visual (for selecting). This ensures that each operation will be highly efficient as it is optimized for a specific task. Next, the course elaborates further on the optimizations Vim makes.<\/p>\n<p>Vim\u2019s interface is a programming language. You do not need to memorize tons of keystrokes. Instead, the few keystrokes you do need to remember can be composed together to form an action that tells the editor what to do, just like a programming language. You\u2019ll learn the basics of Vim, from movement to selection to edits.<\/p>\n<p>The course then moves on to a demonstration of Vim in action to see how amazing Vim can be for productivity. You\u2019ll then learn how to customize Vim by changing the Vim config and extending Vim by installing essential Vim plugins. The course then ends by listing a few critical advanced Vim features, like search and replace macros and multiple windows.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 1 hour long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture video and following along with the instructor as he demonstrates Vim. The course comes with exercises that\u2019ll allow you to practice your Vim.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Massachusetts Institute of Technology<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>YouTube<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Anish Athalye, Jon Gjengset, and Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>1 hour long<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td>313K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Likes<\/b><\/td>\n<td>5.9K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This lecture is from a larger series called <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education<\/i>.

You\u2019ll learn how to save frequent sequences of keystrokes into one keypress and store phrases within multiple registers if you need to keep track of multiple at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Vim, in its default installation, is capable, but you\u2019ll probably want to make it as up-to-date as other modern code editors.
