I guess I would have to say that I would first wish that the genie would grant me three wishes for the book, rather than just one. And if the genie did grant me the three wishes, it would be these, in descending order of importance. First, I\u2019d wish that the book truly helps those who read it lead a happier and more fulfilling life. That is, I would wish that the book isn\u2019t just an \u201cinteresting read\u201d but that it actually makes an impact on what ultimately matters most to people: to lead a happy, meaningful, fulfilling life. Second, I would wish that the book reaches as many people as possible from various corners of the earth, from Kathmandu to Timbuktu. I feel that everyone would benefit from an overall boost in happiness and that everybody\u2014no matter their background\u2014deserves to be equally happy. And finally, I would wish that I myself evolve towards mitigating the various happiness sins and nurturing the happiness habits. I believe that I have already achieved some of that progress through writing the book and by thinking repeatedly about its contents, but I feel that there is still much \u201cinternal\u201d work left to be done.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Dr.-Happy-Smarts-Quote.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62034\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Dr.-Happy-Smarts-Quote.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Happy Smarts Quote\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Dr.-Happy-Smarts-Quote.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Dr.-Happy-Smarts-Quote-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0You are planning to use your royalties to subsidize the cost of the book to those who cannot afford the full price. Don&#8217;t you like money?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>But I like something else even more than I like money: having a good time.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong> I do like money. I think that, all else being equal, more money is better. But I like something else even more than I like money: having a good time. By subsidizing the cost of the book to those who cannot afford it, I believe I would make it more likely to have a good time by achieving two things. First, I would have a higher chance of surrounding myself with happier people, which will boost my happiness levels. Second, I would nurture the sense of abundance\u2014the feeling that I already have enough\u2014that is so critical for happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from enhancing my own happiness levels, there\u2019s another reason why I want to use my royalties to subsidize the book: I am curious about how long the chain of subsidies will last. I\u2019d probably have to sell 10 books at full price in order to fully subsidize another book. So, sooner or later, the \u201cwell\u201d will dry up and I won\u2019t be able to subsidize the book to new buyers. I am hoping that it takes years\u2014or at least a few months\u2014for the well to dry up, and that it doesn\u2019t dry up in just a few weeks!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0Are you thinking of accepting donations from anyone to help keep the chain alive for longer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong>\u00a0That\u2019s a great idea, Robert! Thanks for mentioning it. I will need to think a little more, but yes, I am open to accepting donations from readers who have enjoyed my book or my Coursera course to make donations that will help defray the cost of buying the book. Thanks for asking this question!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert: Did your happiness increase while you were writing the book and teaching the course on MOOC? If so, why do you think that happened?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong>\u00a0Yes, I would say it did increase. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that, in the process of putting together the notes for my classes and then writing the book, I gained greater clarity on what it takes to lead a happier and more fulfilling life. As they say, the best way to learn about something is to teach it, and I certainly experienced that. One of the things that I learned\u2014and this may have been the most important lesson\u2014is that it doesn\u2019t matter how much better you know a happiness concept, it\u2019s critical that you practice the happiness exercises; otherwise, you are not going to see a boost in happiness. In other words, actually behaving in a way that\u2019s consistent with the habits of the highly happy is much more important than it is to have greater conceptual clarity about the various sins and habits.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br \/>\n&#8220;Dr Raj has made an easy accessible, smart and fun course of the most important life lessons.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/2860\/coursera-a-life-of-happiness-and-fulfillment#review-11357\">Course Review By Fleur<\/a><span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Another reason my happiness levels increased is because of the tremendous positive feedback that I have gotten from those taking my Coursera course and reading sample chapters of my book. I feel more efficacious as a human being as a result. I feel that what I have to offer is actually useful and impactful and that makes me feel good.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert: In what ways, if any, are MOOC students different from the business school students you usually teach?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong>\u00a0There are many ways in which they are different. First, and most obvious, they are much larger in numbers. In a typical MBA class, I teach 30 maybe 40 students. The biggest classes I have had are about 70 strong. The numbers in my MOOC are orders or magnitude higher. I currently have over 75,000 students taking my Coursera course.<\/p>\n<p>The students in the MOOC are also more diverse. In a typical MBA class, most students are from just one country: US in Austin and India in Hyderabad. By contrast, in my Coursera course, only about 25% of students are from the US, and only about 15% from India. The rest are from all around the world. In fact, I literally have students from every single country in the world, which means that I literally have students from every imaginable background: poor, rich, white collar, blue collar, Buddhist, Muslim, Zoraoastraian, etc.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>&#8220;I literally have students from every single country in the world, which means that I literally have students from every imaginable background: poor, rich, white collar, blue collar, Buddhist, Muslim, Zoraoastraian, etc.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">&#8220;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The MOOC students are also older. Over half the students are employed full time, and only about 15% are full-time students, whereas in my MBA class, everyone is a full-time student. This means that we have a group of people with a very different set of life experiences and perspectives in the MOOC. For the most part, the MOOC students tend to be less hung up on the science of happiness; they are more interested in what will make their lives happier and more fulfilling instead.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, I have to say that I love teaching both audiences; I celebrate the differences between them, rather than think of them as an impediment or a challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0You end the course, which I have recommended to so many people, by saying that the recipe for a life of happiness and fulfillment is a &#8220;Win \/ Win \/ Win&#8221; recipe. What do you mean by that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong>\u00a0Great question. To tell you what I mean by it, I think it will be useful to rewind a bit. When I first started teaching my course on happiness, my interest and focus was very self-centered and individualistic. I wished to distill from the scientific evidence the principles that would help enhance my personal\u2014or each individual student\u2019s\u2014happiness. In the course of putting the course content together, however, I discovered that the things that lead to happiness are also the things that make one more successful.<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you a concrete example. It turns out that, to feel happy, it\u2019s important to have a sense of competence, a sense that you are really good at doing something. One way to become more competent at something is by wanting to be the best at it\u2014the best student, the best dancer, etc. Another way to become competent is to just follow your passion and experience what are called \u201cflow moments\u201d\u2014moments in which you completely lose track of time and the sense of self-consciousness. From the point of view of maximizing happiness, it should be relatively obvious that pursuing your passion and experiencing flow is better than chasing superiority and wanting to be the best at something. What\u2019s less obvious, but what I discovered from looking into the research on the topic is that, even from the point of view of success, it\u2019s better to pursue your passion and experience flow than it is to chase superiority.<\/p>\n<p>This is just one example, but what I found across all the other determinants of happiness too\u2014like feeling a sense of connection with others, or feeling a sense of autonomy and control over your life\u2014that the things that lead to happiness also enhance the chances of success. And not just that, what I also found is that, the things that lead to happiness typically also enhance the happiness of the others around us. So, for example, people around you\u2014like your colleagues\u2014are likely to be much happier if you are someone who pursues your passion and experiences flow than if you chase superiority over them. Likewise, you make others happy by seeking, what I call, \u201cthe need to love and give\u201d rather by being \u201cdesperate for others love,\u201d and so on.<\/p>\n<p>So, that\u2019s what I mean by the \u201cWin \/ Win \/ Win\u201d idea\u2014that the things that lead to happiness also enhance your chances of success and make others happy. I should mention that I was very excited to discover this since it confirmed what I knew at some instinctive level\u2014that the pursuit of happiness is not a selfish goal, even though it might seem like it on the face of it, it\u2019s actually a noble goal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0You state that feeling that one is good at something (attaining flow) makes us happier. How important do you think it is that an individual believes that he or she is a good person or on a path to becoming a better person?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong>\u00a0Again, great question, Robert. Feeling that one is a good person is a critical, perhaps <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the<\/span> most critical, determinant of happiness. There are many reasons for this. One reason is that, when you feel you are a good person, you come to believe that you can affect others\u2019 lives in a positive fashion, so you end up believing that you are a competent person. As I mentioned earlier, the feeling of competence is an important driver of happiness. Another, even more important reason why feeling that you are a good person enhances happiness levels is because it makes you feel that your life is abundant. That is, you start to believe that the reason you can afford to be good to others, and focus on their worries and concerns is because your own life is in order; if you didn\u2019t feel that way\u2014that is, if you felt that your life wasn\u2019t going well\u2014you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to focus on others\u2019 worries as easily. This feeling of abundance, which is associated with the feeling that life is good and that you are taken care of, is a very important reason why believing that you are a good person\u2014a person who cares for others and is willing to expend effort, time, and money to improve others\u2019 lives\u2014improves happiness levels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0Your forthcoming book is titled, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Youre-Smart-Why-Arent-Happy\/dp\/1101980737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If You&#8217;re So Smart, Why Aren&#8217;t You Happy?<\/a>&#8221; It seems that you are targeting the smart-and-successful crowd\u2014like the MBAs that you teach. Why did you choose this target audience?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Raj:<\/strong> You are correct in observing that the target audience for the book is the smart-and-the-successful. However, while it might seem that by targeting the smart-and-successful, I am implicitly suggesting that their happiness matters more, that\u2019s not the reason why I chose to target this audience. There are actually three reasons why I chose this target audience. First, I found it curious that the smart-and-successful aren\u2019t as happy as they could\u2014or should\u2014be. Several researchers, like Sonja Lyubomirsky and Dacher Keltner, have observed that, despite greater advances in terms of material wealth and comfort, we aren\u2019t that much happier than those who came before us. I find this to be very curious. So, I thought I would delve into why the smart-and-successful, who are otherwise so good at achieving their important goals, aren\u2019t that much better than the rest of us in achieving what is widely acknowledged as one of our most important goals: the goal of leading a happier and more fulfilling life.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason I chose to target this audience is because, as I mentioned in my response to the earlier question, it turns out that the things that lead to happiness also enhance the happiness of others. One reason for this is that being a happier person involves becoming less self-centered and greedy and more other-centered and generous. I felt that in the present context of rising inequality and other such problems, it would be good to get the people with greater access to resources to realize that letting go of some of the self-centeredness will not only get them closer to what they are looking for\u2014greater happiness and fulfillment\u2014but will also enhance the happiness of all those with whom they are in contact.<\/p>\n<p>A final reason that I chose this target audience has to do with the fact that I am most familiar with the problems and challenges that people in this group face. From the outside, it might seem that the smart-and-the-successful have everything going for them: they are richer, more talented, etc. But from the inside\u2014and I know this from personal observations\u2014being smart and successful is no guarantee of happiness. And to me, everyone, regardless of their background, deserves to lead a happier and more fulfilling life. So, since I can most empathize with the trials and tribulations of the smart-and-successful crowd, I decided to focus on them in my book.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert:\u00a0I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on your book, Raj.
