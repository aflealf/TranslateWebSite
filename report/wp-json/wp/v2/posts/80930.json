It acts as an extension or a superset of the C programming language (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-free-c-programming-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which I have written a ranking about<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>What makes C++ extremely popular is that it is not only fast, efficient, flexible, and provides direct control over hardware like its older brother C, but it also improves on C in several aspects. For example, it was created for object-oriented programming, and provides exception handling and function overloading, which were not available in C. In addition, every three years, the C++ language is revised to support ground-breaking new features, which get the language on par with C# and Java, but without the performance penalty of a garbage collector.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Java, C++ is poised to be the next language to overtake Java, the third most popular programming language <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the TIOBE Index<\/a>. As a result, many employers are looking for programmers with experience in C++, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/c-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Glassdoor<\/a>, the estimated total pay for a C++ Developer is $113K a year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

Nevertheless, you\u2019ll still have an excellent understanding of C++ as well, such that you\u2019ll be able to write good programs.<\/p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of C++ is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by introducing you to the basic concepts of programming. Then, after setting up your development environment, you\u2019ll learn about variables and expressions in C++, along with conditional and iterative statements that\u2019ll help you control the flow of your program. Next, you\u2019ll learn about functions. Finally, you\u2019ll use them to reuse code blocks by passing arguments into them.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll learn more advanced data types, the first being tables. Tables allow you to group several data of the same kind. Tables can be vectors or arrays and can also be one-dimensional or multidimensional. Strings, which are related to arrays, will also be taught. You\u2019ll learn how to create and manipulate strings of text to be displayed on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>The course\u2019s final weeks go through pointers and references, something every C++ programmer must be familiar with. Pointers and references allow you to refer to other existing data or dynamically create new data. You\u2019ll find out how useful these are, along with the different concepts you\u2019ve learned so far, when the course goes through a case study of creating a game of \u2018Connect 4\u2019, where the cost also presents the last data type: the enumerated type.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 8 weeks long with 34 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn primarily from watching the lecture videos (with French subtitles), completing the practice quizzes and practice programming exercises, and reading through the course notes. Additionally, all learners will have access to the graded weekly quizzes and graded programming assignments to assess your coding abilities.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de
